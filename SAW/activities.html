                    <p> - I've been regularly going to the casual sessions for badminton, I wanted to join the team but sadly I was ill during the trial sessions</p>
                    <p> - I did manage to be a part of The Kdragons society, a kpop/hiphop dance troupe</p>
                    <P> - I was really looking forward to the group project due since it was an oppurtunity to get to know others on my course but only 1 person from my team of 7 actually participated, even then I had to present alone lol</P>
                    <P> - I volunteered at a repair cafe for waste awareness week where I managed to fix a toaster! I also got to see how PAT testing is done and have a great conversation with a cute old lady repairing textiles</P>
